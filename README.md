# Real-Time Chat App

This is a real-time chat application built using Express.js, Socket.IO, and PostgreSQL. It allows users to chat with each other in real-time and stores chat messages in a PostgreSQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js used for handling HTTP requests and serving HTML files.
- **Socket.IO**: A JavaScript library for real-time web applications, enabling bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used for storing chat messages.
- **dotenv**: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time without the need to refresh the page.
- **Message Storage**: Chat messages are stored in a PostgreSQL database, allowing users to access past messages even after refreshing the page or joining the chat later.
